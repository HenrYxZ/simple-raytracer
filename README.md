# simple-raytracer

Simple Raytracer written in pure Python. It's main purpose is to help
understand how raytracing works. If you are looking for an efficient raytracer
you should probably use something like C++. The equations used are from the
Image Synthesis class at Texas A&M University taught by professor Ergun Akleman 

It creates a raytraced image of a scene with simple objects like spheres and
planes

## Usage

- Install all the dependencies required
- Run `python main.py`
- The output image will be stored in the project folder

## Dependencies

You will need to install
- Python (currently working with python 2.7, it should work with 3 too)

And Python modules
- numpy
- pillow

You can install python modules, for example, by running:
`python -m pip install numpy pillow`
